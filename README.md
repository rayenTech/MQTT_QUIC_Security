# MQTT_QUIC_Security
A project integrating real-time cybersecurity data transmission using MQTT and QUIC with ThingSpeak. It simulates a SIEM like Wazuh to analyze intrusion attempts, security alerts, and firewall activities, offering visualization and enhanced security management through an intuitive interface.
# Cybersecurity Metrics Monitoring with MQTT, QUIC, and Wazuh Simulation

This project demonstrates real-time transmission and monitoring of cybersecurity metrics using the **MQTT** and **QUIC** protocols, integrated with **ThingSpeak** for visualization. It includes a **SIEM simulation with Wazuh**, providing advanced analysis and insights into intrusion attempts, security alerts, and system activities.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Transmission**: Send cybersecurity metrics like intrusion attempts, CPU usage, and firewall blocks using **MQTT** and the **QUIC** transport protocol.
- **Visualization with ThingSpeak**: View and analyze data trends on ThingSpeak dashboards.
- **SIEM Simulation**: Leverages **Wazuh** for intrusion detection, threat analysis, and centralized log monitoring.

## Installation

1. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install paho-mqtt pyquic requests matplotlib
